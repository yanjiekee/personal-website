                            Apparently, the way I have associated myself with my 'occupation' is a well-known phenomenon called 'Enmeshment'. It's when you are overly dependent on the identity in your work, bad things can happen when you stopped doing the same thing later.

                            To fix this, I'll reintroduce myself, using this website, through: </br>

                        <p>Quote of the web update:</p>
                        <p>"The evil that is in the world always comes of ignorance, and good intentions may do as much harm as malevolence, if they lack understanding. On the whole, men are more good than bad; that, however, isn't the real point. But they are more or less ignorant, and it is this that we call vice and virtue; the most incorrigible vice being that of an ignorance that fancies it knows everything and therefore claims for itself the right to kill." - The Plague</p>
